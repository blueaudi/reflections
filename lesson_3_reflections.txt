When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When other people are also making changes to files in the repository, or the author
	is using a different computer to also make changes.
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Pulling changes manually allows you to choose which changes, including changes made
	by other users, to your local repository.
