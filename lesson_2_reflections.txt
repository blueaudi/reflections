What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git directory is created containing files/folders necessary to
	provide version tracking.  This creates the framework git requires
	for tracking.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository?  What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area contains those files in the working directory that
	we want to be contained in the commit.  This allows the segregation
	of files in the working directory that will be included in the commit
	and those that will not.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

	Ummmmmmmmm?  I don't know the answer to this one!
