What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git directory is created containing files/folders necessary to
	provide version tracking.  This creates the framework git requires
	for tracking.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository?  What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area contains those files in the working directory that
	we want to be contained in the commit.  This allows the segregation
	of files in the working directory that will be included in the commit
	and those that will not.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

	Ummmmmmmmm?  I don't know the answer to this one!

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches might be helpful when major, experimental changes are being
	made to a project, while improvements to the main branch can still
	be made and committed.  At some future point, the branches can be
	merged if desired.
